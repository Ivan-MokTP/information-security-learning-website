                                Authentication is the process of identifying someone on the Internet. The reason for this is to provide access control to the users who want to access the required information. Before granted the information, the user has to prove his identity to the system. This is usually done by providing username/user id and password, which are known as login credentials. With the correct credential, the user is recognized and will be provided the requested information.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Taking facebook as an example. Every registered account is an identity, and is bound with a unique username(probably email) and a password. To prove an identity, the user has to provide the correct username and password. Since the password should be kept secret to only the user himeself, no other user can steal one's identity without knowing the password.

                        Why is this important?
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Authentication is important because it enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users (or processes) to access its protected resources, which may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services.  
                    </p>
                    <p  >
                        After successful authentication, the users will be granted the right to perform different levels of actions depending on the identity. Since only the authenticated users have the permission to perform certain actions, it provides access control over the system, making it secure and easy to manage user rights.
